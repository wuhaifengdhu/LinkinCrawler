Through a unique approach to deliberate practice, each company within Peaksware develops software solutions and provides services focused solely on their respective markets to help guide people along their own journey of improvement and skill development.\\nOur Engineering Philosophy\\n DevOps - We want developers to have insight and ownership over code in production, integration tools, infrastructure, and deployment process. Developers should always ask what it takes to support their systems/code in production. We value The Phoenix Project as a reference guide. Product Efficiency is achieved upstream - The further down the development pipeline we have to fix bugs or rework features, the more expensive it is. Small, Cross-Functional Teams - QA, Dev, Design, CI, and Product working on a focused and shared vision. Complexity - It\'s easy to make something complex, but difficult to make it simple. We should always be fighting complexity. Can we deprecate systems/code? Do it. Does the system need to be that complicated? Do we build vs buy? Small Batch Sizes - Constantly work towards shorter release cycles as a means to shore up quality, help make sure we are working on the right things at the right time, stabilize operations, and cut down on waste. Performance matters - We value engineers that know not to over optimize solutions, but always think how code will perform at expected scale. Minimum Process Necessary - We strive to be pragmatic. Some process is necessary, but don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the fundamentals of Agile.  Managing Technical Debt - The vast majority of work is maintenance. Engineers need to have practical philosophies on refactoring. We like the theory of Broken Windows, YAGNI, and refactor as you go. We appreciate Clean Code, Working Effectively with Legacy Code, and Pragmatic Programmer as reference guides. Data Driven - Let\xe2\x80\x99s use the data to help inform what to work on, what is causing performance issues, who is using our features... Ultimately it\'s the objective plus the narrative that produces great product. \\nOur Data Principles\\n Accurate and Dependable - When people trust your data, they\xe2\x80\x99ll use it Accessible - When people can easily access the data they need, they\xe2\x80\x99ll use it Actionable - When data is relevant and useful, it will get used Democratized - When people can answer their own questions, they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it Flexible - When people can dive deep to find answers, they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it Secure - When people know your data is secure, they\xe2\x80\x99ll use it Used - Above all, when people truly use data to inform decisions, that\xe2\x80\x99s success \\nBenefits And Perks\\n 100% company paid medical plan for employees with buy-up options as well as dental and vision insurance for employees (dependent coverage available) $1,200/year fitness reimbursement to purchase any items related to healthy living 3 weeks of PTO for all new hires.
