Normal weekly schedule is M-TH travel to client location (U.S. based)Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?We don\u2019t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data &amp; Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don\u2019t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline \u2013 in terms they can understand \u2013 why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We\u2019re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here\u2019s a suggestion \u2013 if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.At this time, we are only considering candidates interested in full-time employment who do not require visa sponsorships or transfers.Clarity Insights is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. We believe in treating each employee and applicant for employment fairly and with dignity.GLDR
