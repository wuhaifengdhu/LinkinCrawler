As a participant in this program, you will be quickly involved in multiple areas across Monsanto\'s Technology Organization, and you will work with, and be mentored by Monsanto\'s most talented scientific leaders. You will emerge prepared to lead efforts focused on agricultural innovation. \\nMonsanto is looking for the next generation of leaders in the field of data science. We are seeking a highly motivated individual to join the cutting edge Emerging Leaders in Science Program (ELS). The successful candidate will have a demonstrated track record of competitive accomplishments. As part of the ELS program, you will be expected to foster and advance cross technology efforts to meet scientific challenges that address Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to global agriculture. The position is for an integral member of a multidisciplinary, results-driven, customer focused growing automation team. The position represents a full-time, career opportunity in an exciting, dynamic environment serving a broad range of research and development needs of a Life Sciences Company. The person filling this position must have highly effective verbal and written communication skills, the ability to work collaboratively with diverse stakeholders, the agility to respond rapidly to challenges as they arise and possess clear potential for rapid growth and learning. \\nThe world population is expected to exceed nine billion by 2050. One of this century\xe2\x80\x99s major scientific challenges is to feed that growing population sustainably, affordably and with minimal impact on the environment. The next major advances in agriculture will require integrating information from Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Agronomy, Weather and Breeding. Monsanto is committed to solving these challenges. You will apply rigorous analytical methods to test assumptions and find hidden insights among rich, diverse, heterogeneous data sets. These data sets include environmental and yield data from millions of crop acres, genomic data from hundreds of thousands of hybrid plant crosses and metagenomic samples teeming with microbial diversity. \\nTurning these inventions into tangible benefits for society requires more than scientific expertise. It also requires leadership: the foresight to identify strategic gaps and challenges, the ability to influence others to work toward a shared vision, and a gift for clarity in communication.
