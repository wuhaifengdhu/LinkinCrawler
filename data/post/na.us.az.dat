Clear thinking and honed reasoning and analytical skills are absolutely essential to do this successfully.\\nPHYSICAL DEMAND\\nWhile performing the duties of the job, the employee will be required to regularly use a PC, telephone, fax machine, copy machine, lift objects, speak, hear, and write.

S'"text":"This job was posted by http://www.azjobconnection.gov : For more information, please see: http://www.azjobconnection.gov/ada/r/jobs/2560662\\nThe Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) operates several observatory centers (including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the National Solar Observatory, and the Gemini Observatory) in the United States and Chile under cooperative agreements with the National Science Foundation.\\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Project is currently constructing an 8.4 meter diameter ground-based observatory in Chile and a 3.2 gigapixel camera with funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. The telescope will survey the visible sky every few nights in six optical bands to address four key science themes: Constraining the nature of dark energy and dark matter, making an inventory of small moving bodies in the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and determining the accretion history of the Milky Way.\\nDetermining the optimal observing strategy to simultaneously achieve the multiple science goals is performed via a complex scheduling algorithm - the \\"Scheduler\\". The Scheduler is the brain of the LSST survey and is now in construction as part of the Telescope and Site (T&amp;S) group. LSST is designed to conduct a sequence of \\"visits\\", each covering ~ 10 square degrees of sky, and consisting of two consecutive 15s exposures. The Scheduler will determine the sequence of visits on any given night, i.e. the locations of the successive telescope pointings on the sky and the choice of filter for each pointing, taking explicit account of observing conditions and the history of visits to date. The various scientific objectives place different constraints on the Scheduler, and the overall optimization will require a definition of those constraints, a specification of how they should be quantified and measured, and the construction of an efficient scheduling code to implement them.\\nThe job of the LSST Survey Scientist is to lead the development and optimization of the Scheduler.\\nEssential Functions Include\\nEnsuring the delivery of a scheduler that meets its technical requirements and LSST scientific goals, working closely with the Scheduler developer(s), the LSST simulations team, and the scientific community.\\nLeading a Scheduler verification process during the Telescope and Site Integration and Test phase.\\nManaging the construction of the Scheduler development with the OCS manager, evaluating potential cost and schedule impacts of proposed requirement changes motivated by community input.\\nLeading analyses of the scientific impact on the LSST survey resulting from changes in scheduling algorithms, scheduling parameters, observatory constraints and environmental conditions, as well as changes in science proposals.\\nInterfacing with the relevant stakeholders in T&amp;S team and the Project Science Team as well as the scientific community.\\nMaintaining an active scientific interest in selected scientific investigations enabled by LSST and publishing in refereed journals\\nThe Survey Scientist will be a member of the T&amp;S group, based primarily in Tucson, AZ. He/she is expected to collaborate closely with the T&amp;S Project Scientist, the Scheduler Developer and the LSST simulations team. Some travel to La Serena, Chile will also be required, especially during the period when the LSST undergoes integration and test, and commissioning. The Survey Scientist will report to the LSST Director, but will take direction from the T&amp;S Project Manager and the T&amp;S Project Scientist."},"formattedEmploymentStatus":"Full-time","title":"Survey Scientist - AZ02560662","entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_normalized_jobPosting:315183350","jobRegion":"urn:li:fs_region:(us,852)","applyMethod":{"com.linkedin.voyager.jobs.OffsiteApply":{"applyStartersPreferenceVoid":false,"companyApplyUrl":"https://my.jobs/E3FCA37B36B0454A97D9D6D84775B3C55044"}},"views":0,"savingInfo":{"saved":false,"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_jobSavingInfo:315183350"},"new":false,"eligibleForReferrals":false,"formattedJobFunctions":["Research","Analyst","Information Technology"],"formattedLocation":"Tucson, AZ, US","companyDescription":{"attributes":[{"start":51,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":52,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":79,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":109,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":133,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":148,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":180,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":197,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":224,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":226,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":290,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}}],"text":"A multi-disciplinary event agency, specializing in \\n\\nBrand &amp; service launches; \\nInaugural &amp; protocol events, \\nSeminar &amp; conferences, \\nDealer meets, \\nLive concerts for TV &amp; Non-TV, \\nSpecial events, \\nSpace &amp; environment design\\n \\n- Conducting activities across India &amp; International locations.\\n- Attention to details, timely suggestions and meticulous planning are our forte."},"listedAt":1491243013000,"expireAt":1494785235000,"jobPostingUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/315183350/?trk=jobs_biz_prem_srch","formattedExperienceLevel":"Associate","applies":0,"formattedIndustries":["Events Services"],"entityUrnResolutionResult":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_normalized_jobPosting:315183350","relevanceReasonInjectionResult":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_jobPostingRelevanceReason:(urn:li:fs_normalized_jobPosting:315183350,_)","jobPosting":"urn:li:fs_normalized_jobPosting:315183350","details":{"com.linkedin.voyager.jobs.shared.HiddenGemRelevanceReasonDetails":{}}}},"sourceDomain":"my.jobs","applyingInfo":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_jobApplyingInfo:315183350","applied":false},"jobRegionResolutionResult":{"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_region:(us,852)","regionName":"Tucson, Arizona Area"}}\n  '

S'"text":"Description\\nThe Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) operates several observatory centers (including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the National Solar Observatory, and the Gemini Observatory) in the United States and Chile under cooperative agreements with the National Science Foundation.\\nThe Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Project is currently constructing an 8.4 meter diameter ground-based observatory in Chile and a 3.2 gigapixel camera with funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. The telescope will survey the visible sky every few nights in six optical bands to address four key science themes: Constraining the nature of dark energy and dark matter, making an inventory of small moving bodies in the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and determining the accretion history of the Milky Way.\\nDetermining the optimal observing strategy to simultaneously achieve the multiple science goals is performed via a complex scheduling algorithm - the \xe2\x80\x9cScheduler\xe2\x80\x9d. The Scheduler is the brain of the LSST survey and is now in construction as part of the Telescope and Site (T&amp;S) group. LSST is designed to conduct a sequence of \xe2\x80\x9cvisits\xe2\x80\x9d, each covering ~ 10 square degrees of sky, and consisting of two consecutive 15s exposures. The Scheduler will determine the sequence of visits on any given night, i.e. the locations of the successive telescope pointings on the sky and the choice of filter for each pointing, taking explicit account of observing conditions and the history of visits to date. The various scientific objectives place different constraints on the Scheduler, and the overall optimization will require a definition of those constraints, a specification of how they should be quantified and measured, and the construction of an efficient scheduling code to implement them.\\nThe job of the LSST Survey Scientist is to lead the development and optimization of the Scheduler.\\nEssential Functions Include\\nEnsuring the delivery of a scheduler that meets its technical requirements and LSST scientific goals, working closely with the Scheduler developer(s), the LSST simulations team, and the scientific community.Leading a Scheduler verification process during the Telescope and Site Integration and Test phase.Managing the construction of the Scheduler development with the OCS manager, evaluating potential cost and schedule impacts of proposed requirement changes motivated by community input.Leading analyses of the scientific impact on the LSST survey resulting from changes in scheduling algorithms, scheduling parameters, observatory constraints and environmental conditions, as well as changes in science proposals.Interfacing with the relevant stakeholders in T&amp;S team and the Project Science Team as well as the scientific community.Maintaining an active scientific interest in selected scientific investigations enabled by LSST and publishing in refereed journals\\nThe Survey Scientist will be a member of the T&amp;S group, based primarily in Tucson, AZ. He/she is expected to collaborate closely with the T&amp;S Project Scientist, the Scheduler Developer and the LSST simulations team. Some travel to La Serena, Chile will also be required, especially during the period when the LSST undergoes integration and test, and commissioning. The Survey Scientist will report to the LSST Director, but will take direction from the T&amp;S Project Manager and the T&amp;S Project Scientist."},"formattedEmploymentStatus":"Full-time","title":"Survey Scientist","entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_normalized_jobPosting:276586997","jobRegion":"urn:li:fs_region:(us,852)","applyMethod":{"com.linkedin.voyager.jobs.OffsiteApply":{"applyStartersPreferenceVoid":false,"companyApplyUrl":"https://rn11.ultipro.com/spa1004B/JobBoard/JobDetails.aspx?__ID=*246FA6D0094F801D&amp;utm_source=LINKEDIN&amp;utm_medium=referrer"}},"views":22,"savingInfo":{"saved":false,"entityUrn":"urn:li:fs_jobSavingInfo:276586997"},"new":false,"eligibleForReferrals":false,"formattedJobFunctions":["Research","Analyst","Information Technology"],"formattedLocation":"Tucson, AZ, US","companyDescription":{"attributes":[{"start":348,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}},{"start":349,"length":1,"type":{"com.linkedin.pemberly.text.LineBreak":{}}}],"text":"NOAO, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, is the US national research &amp; development center for ground-based night time astronomy.
